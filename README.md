## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andy Bennett. I earned my PhD in analytical chemistry with a focus on liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) omics.

While working on my PhD, I felt the need to learn better data processing skills and fell in love with R. I thoroughly enjoy the data analysis process, particularly data visualization. 

I love finding and implementing processes to better handle data and ways to understand the world. 

I am primarily focused on learning/using R, but working on developing my Python skills as well.
